## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Global variables
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this challenge, I learned about **Global Variables** from the W3Schools website, this function allowed me to code faster in my stylesheet because I was able to formulate variables in my root and apply them to within some of my properties such as line-spacing, font-size, and many more.



```css
:root {
  --Yellow:#f4d04e;
  --Gray-950:#111111;
  --Gray-500:#6b6b6b;
  --White:#ffffff;
}

body {
  background-color:var(--Yellow);
}
```

### Continued development

I still need a better understanding of flexboxes, and the position property because I was having a hard time centering the copyright text under the card in the mobile design.

### Useful resources

- [www.W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) - This website helped me understand Global Variables.
